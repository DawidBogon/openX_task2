# OpenX task2
Recruitment task for OpenX Deals/API Intern

It was my first time working with pytest so the tests are not best. I tried installing freeztime in order to test it properly but it did not work. Next thing i wanted to do is to test it in diffrent enviroments using tox and run tests on github automatically.
In order to run tests simply execute commad(You have to be in parent directory of this repository, from folder openX_task2 run command cd ../):
``` pytest```

There is some parts of code left to be written better, but sadly I did not have enough time to fix it.
